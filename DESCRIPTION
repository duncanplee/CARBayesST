Description: Implements a class of univariate and multivariate spatio-temporal generalised linear mixed models for areal unit data, with inference in a Bayesian setting using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation. The response variable can be binomial, Gaussian, or Poisson, but for some models only the binomial and Poisson data likelihoods are available. The spatio-temporal autocorrelation is modelled by  random effects, which are assigned conditional autoregressive (CAR) style prior distributions. A number of different random effects structures are available, including models similar to Bernardinelli et al. (1995) <doi:10.1002/sim.4780142112> and Rushworth et al. (2014) <doi:10.1016/j.sste.2014.05.001>. Full details are given in the vignette accompanying this package.
